# Fraud Detector
A fraud detection solution

Business Description:
The Fraud Detection Web App is a solution designed to assist businesses and individuals in quickly assessing whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent or not. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and provide predictions regarding the authenticity of the transaction. The app aims to streamline decision-making processes, enhance security, and reduce financial losses associated with fraudulent activities.

#### Objectives of the Solution

- **Efficient Fraud Detection:** To efficiently and accurately detect potentially fraudulent transactions. By utilizing machine learning models trained on historical data, the app aims to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent behavior.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system easily. Users can upload CSV files containing transaction data for analysis, making the process seamless and accessible to individuals with varying technical backgrounds.

- **Real-Time Assessment:** Businesses and individuals can receive real-time assessments of transactions. This timely feedback empowers users to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with a transaction or initiate further investigation.

- **Risk Mitigation:** By identifying fraudulent transactions early, the app assists businesses in mitigating financial and reputational risks associated with fraudulent activities. This can result in cost savings and improved customer trust.

- **Adaptability and Customization:** The solution can be tailored to accommodate specific business requirements and datasets. Users can modify the app's features, algorithms, and thresholds to suit their unique needs.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The app empowers users with data-driven insights, enabling them to make decisions based on evidence rather than intuition. This supports more objective decision-making processes.

- **Scalability:** The solution can be scaled to accommodate growing volumes of transaction data. As the dataset increases, the machine learning models can continue to learn and improve their accuracy.

- **Integration:** The app can be integrated into existing business systems and workflows. This allows for seamless incorporation of fraud detection capabilities without disrupting existing processes.

- **Continuous Improvement:** Through the analysis of prediction results and user feedback, the solution can be continuously refined and improved to enhance accuracy and user satisfaction.

### Installation
1. **Setup and Dependencies:**

Make sure you have Streamlit installed. If not, you can install it using **pip install streamlit**.
Create a new Python script, let's call it **fraud_detection_app.py**, where you'll write the Streamlit app code.

2. **Loading Preprocessed Data and Model:**

At the beginning of the script, you need to load the preprocessed dataset and the best trained model that you created in your previous steps. This involves importing the necessary libraries, loading the dataset, preprocessing it (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, etc.), and training multiple models to select the best one.

3. **Creating the Streamlit App:**

Import the **streamlit** library at the beginning of your script: **import streamlit as st**.
Use **st.title()*** to set the title of your app: **st.title('Fraud Detection App')**.

4. **Uploading CSV Data:**

Use **st.file_uploader()** to create a file uploader widget that allows users to upload a CSV file containing the feature values for prediction.
Specify the allowed file type using the type parameter: **type=["csv"]**.
Store the uploaded file in the uploaded_file variable: uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file", type=["csv"]).

5. **Processing Uploaded Data:**

Within an if statement, check if a file has been uploaded: if uploaded_file is not None:.
Use **pd.read_csv()** to read the uploaded CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame: **df_uploaded = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)**.
Display the uploaded data using **st.write()**: **st.write("Uploaded CSV file:")** and **st.write(df_uploaded)**.

6. **Feature Extraction and Prediction:**

Assuming the uploaded CSV file has the same format as your training data, you can extract the feature values from the DataFrame and perform prediction.
Extract the feature values for the first row (or any row) of the uploaded data: **sample_data = df_uploaded.iloc[0, :-1].values**.
Standardize the sample data using the pre-trained scaler: **sample_data_standardized = scaler.transform([sample_data])**.
Use the best trained model to predict: **prediction = best_model.predict(sample_data_standardized)**.

7. **Displaying Prediction Result:**

Based on the prediction result, display whether the uploaded data is classified as a fraud transaction or not using st.write().
Running the App:

To run the app, navigate to the directory containing the script in the terminal and execute: streamlit run fraud_detection_app.py.
This will start a local server, and the app will open in your default web browser.
Deployment:

To deploy the app, you can use platforms like Heroku, Streamlit Sharing, or your own server.
Follow the deployment instructions of your chosen platform to make your app accessible online.
